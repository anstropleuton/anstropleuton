## Hi there 👋

### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a hobbyist C++23 programmer passionate about building systems, tools and frameworks as open-source library projects. Over the past 3+ years, I have been exploring the programming world with curiosity and creativity.

Along the way, I have experimented with System Designing, Game Developmenet, Android Apps Development and Web Development. I have used various other programming languages, including C, Python, Rust, Kotlin, C# and React.

I have built many programs to experiment with different ideas, and most of my projects reflect that. Not all are finished, and I am not upset about it. They have served as a creative medium for me to tinker around systems and explore what's possible.

Currently focused on Full Stack Development and AI. I prefer learning through building, by transforming ideas into functioning projects. These projects allows me to learn Frontend (React), Backend (Express/Node/MongoDB) and AI integration (Python/PyTorch/TensorFlow).
