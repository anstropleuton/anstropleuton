            <h1>üëã Hello</h1>
            <p>
              I am a hobbyist C++23 programmer passionate about building
              systems, tools and frameworks as open-source library projects.
              Over the past 3+ years, I have been exploring the programming
              world with curiosity and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the way, I have explored System Designing, Game
              Developmenet, Android Apps Development and Web Development. I have
              used various other programming languages, including C, Python,
              Rust, Kotlin, C# and React.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have built many programs to explore and experiment with
              different ideas, and most of my projects reflect that. I learnt
              from almost all my projects by doing it. They have served as a
              creative medium for me to tinker around systems and explore what's
              possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently focused on Full Stack Development and AI. I prefer
              learning through building, by transforming ideas into functioning
              projects. These projects allows me to learn Frontend (React),
              Backend (Express/Node/MongoDB) and AI integration
              (Python/PyTorch/TensorFlow).

            <h3>Early History</h3>
            <p>
              My journey as a programmer started in year 2021, when I was 15
              years old. I traveled to a village but got stuck due to COVID-19
              lockdown restrictions. I did not even have a computer to begin
              with. I got interest in programming due to bordem and curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used my Mom's phone to create my first game using an app that
              did not require programming knowledge. But that phone died of
              overheading. So I used my old 2014 Android tablet and started
              learning C# in it, using C# Shell for writing code.
            </p>
            <p>
              C# Shell was too slow in that device. That was pivotal moment, as
              I turned to using C++ instead. I used CPP-N-IDE to write C++ code,
              and I was surprised by how fast it was. I soon made progress in
              C++ and wrote many small programs in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I later got to use my Dad's 2008 Windows Laptop, which was much
              faster compared to my tablet. I got started using raylib to write
              some graphical programs, and I like using raylib ever since.

            <h3>Experiments Arc</h3>
            <p>
              From there, my programming journey spiraled into many experiments.
              I really was ambitious (and I continue to be, to this day), so
              many of the projects died due to large scope. Every single project
              served as a learning experience. Few finished, few abandoned, few
              lost to time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I touched many fields during my journey: App Development
              (CLI/GUI), Game Development (using raylib), Library Development,
              Framework Development, Networking, Web Development (lightly),
              Android Apps Development, Windows/Linux Apps Development (WinUI
              3/GTK), and a few others.
              <br />
              Emphasis on <em>touch</em>, I did not explore many of them in
              depth, and I visited them to see how they are all like. I stuck
              with App/Game/Library/Framework development as those are the ones
              I started with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many smaller arcs has formed during my early journey, from
              switching to C instead of C++, to 4 revisions of one project,
              these were like unstructured programming quests.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Impact</h3>
            <p>
              As a proud user of raylib, I got to leave a mark in the community
              through contributions. This was big for me back then, even for
              small code changes. They taught me how real-world collaboration
              works, and later I helped maintain parts of raylib using Python.
              Nothing too big, though.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also stumbled across a bug in GCC. An Internal Compiler Error. I
              followed an instruction to file a bug report to Arch Linux, as
              well as upstream GCC. This allowed me to contribute on a large
              scale project. I followed through the bug report and finally it
              was fixed in GCC 14.
            </p>
            <h3>Modernization</h3>
            <p>
              During my early modern era, I did not finish a lot of projects.
              Many were ambitious projects. They had large codebase as well. I
              tweaked a lot of my programming style to make my codebase as
              maintainable as possible. I gone through iterations after
              iteration. I learnt how to make modern and maintainable codebase.
              Later I created a few smaller but completed projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now as it stands, I am a proud author of over 20 projects, both
              finished and unfinished, and I still like experimenting by
              researching and developing, and I am now exploring various fields
              that are alien to me, including Android App development and Web
              development.
            </p>

              I have currently taken interest in MERN, Vite, T3, Python AI/ML/DL
              using PyTorch/TensorFlow, etc. I am also interested in learning
              Rust to increase my productivity and get a fresh new way of
              thinking about performance and memory.

                </h1>
                <p>
                  Engenide is my dream programming language designed around the
                  idea of liberating developers from arbitrary constraints. It's
                  design is feature-overloaded to allow highly expressive
                  domain-specific code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have crafted a sketch document to specify Engenide's
                  features in a brief way. I do plan to write a
                  compiler/interpreter for Engenide in the future.
